## SquirrelCLSIDForAppUserModelId
Quickly see what ToastActivatorCLSID Squirrel would generate for your AppUserModelId

### What is this
This little tool has the worst name ever (I know), but it does a simple thing: If you'd like to use [Squirrel](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows) to set shortcuts, you may have noticed that it chooses a `ToastActivatorCLSID` for you - mostly to not bother you with the details of what the CLSID should be. However, to actually do anythin with it, you'll need to know what it is. Squirrel will write it to console, but if you want to predict it before it's being created, use this little tool.

:memo: Usage: Run it from PowerShell/CMD.
